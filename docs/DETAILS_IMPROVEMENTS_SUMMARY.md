# Document Details & Preview Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to document details extraction, categorization, and preview formatting to provide a better user experience.

## Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ **1. Enhanced Document Details Extraction**
**Problem:** Limited extraction of key details from conversations.
**Solution:**
- Comprehensive extraction of parties, dates, addresses, and legal terms
- Intelligent parsing of both user and AI messages
- Specific pattern matching for names, addresses, and dates
- Categorized detail organization

### ‚úÖ **2. Document Type Detection**
**Problem:** Generic "Legal Document" type instead of specific document types.
**Solution:**
- Intelligent document type detection based on conversation content
- Support for 10+ specific document types:
  - Property Transfer Agreement
  - Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)
  - Residential/Commercial Lease Agreement
  - Employment Contract
  - Service Agreement
  - Partnership Agreement
  - Loan Agreement
  - Purchase/Sales Agreement
  - Last Will and Testament
  - Power of Attorney

### ‚úÖ **3. Non-Editable Document Type**
**Problem:** Users could accidentally change the document type.
**Solution:**
- Document type field is now disabled/non-editable
- Clear indication that it's automatically detected
- Helpful tooltip explaining the behavior

### ‚úÖ **4. Organized Details Categories**
**Problem:** All details were mixed together without organization.
**Solution:**
- Grouped details into logical categories:
  - üë• **Parties Information** (names, relationships, addresses)
  - üìÖ **Dates & Duration** (agreement dates, periods, deadlines)
  - üè† **Property Details** (addresses, legal descriptions)
  - ‚öñÔ∏è **Legal Terms** (governing law, consideration, transfer types)
  - üìù **Other Details** (miscellaneous information)

### ‚úÖ **5. Improved Document Preview**
**Problem:** Poor formatting and readability in document preview.
**Solution:**
- Enhanced formatting engine with intelligent spacing
- Proper handling of headers, sections, and signatures
- Better paragraph organization
- Professional typography and styling
- Theme-aware preview container

## New Features

- Important dates (agreement date, transfer date)
- Legal descriptions and property details
- Governing law and jurisdiction
- Consideration and transfer terms
```

### üÜï **Smart Document Type Detection**
- Analyzes conversation content for keywords
- Maps to specific legal document types
- Provides accurate categorization
- Non-editable to prevent user errors

### üÜï **Categorized Details Interface**

## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Extraction Patterns
```python
# Name extraction patterns
name_patterns = [
    r"my name is ([a-zA-Z\s]+)",
    r"([a-zA-Z\s]+) \(father\)",
    r"([a-zA-Z\s]+) \(son\)",
    # ... more patterns
]

# Address extraction patterns
address_patterns = [
    r"(\d+\s+[a-zA-Z\s]+(?:street|avenue|road)[^,]*,\s*[a-zA-Z\s]+)",
    # ... more patterns
]

# Date extraction patterns
date_patterns = [
    r"(\d{1,2}(?:st|nd|rd|th)?\s+day\s+of\s+[a-zA-Z]+,?\s+\d{4})",
    # ... more patterns
]
```

### Document Type Detection Logic
```python
# Intelligent document type mapping
if "property" in user_text and "transfer" in user_text:
    document_type = "Property Transfer Agreement"
elif "nda" in user_text or "non-disclosure" in user_text:
    document_type = "Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)"
elif "lease" in user_text and "apartment" in user_text:
    document_type = "Residential Lease Agreement"
# ... more conditions
```

### Improved Formatting Engine
```python
# Enhanced document formatting with:
- Signature section detection
- Header and section spacing
- Bullet point handling
- Legal clause formatting (WHEREAS, NOW THEREFORE)
- Professional paragraph organization
```
